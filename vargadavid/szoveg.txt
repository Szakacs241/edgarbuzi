Hardware: Physical components of a computer system, such as mouse, 
keyboard, and monitor, used for input and output.

Types of computer systems:

- Personal computer: (Laptops, tablets)
The personal computer is one of the most common types of computer due to its versatility and relatively low price.
Desktop personal computers have a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, and a computer case.

Case: A computer case encloses most of the components of a desktop computer system.
Motherboard: The motherboard is the main component of a computer.
Storage devices: A storage device is computer hardware or digital media that is used for storing, porting, and extracting data files and objects.
Fixed media: Data is stored by a computer using a variety of media.
Input and output peripherals: Input and output devices are typically housed externally to the main computer chassis.
Input device: Input devices allow the user to enter information into the system, or control its operation.
Output device: Output devices are designed around the senses of human beings.

- Mainframe computer
A mainframe computer is a much larger computer that typically fills a room and may cost many hundreds or thousands of times as much as a personal computer.
They are designed to perform large numbers of calculations for governments and large enterprises.

- Departmental computing
In the 1960s and 1970s, more and more departments started to use cheaper and dedicated systems for specific purposes like process control and laboratory automation.

- Supercomputer
A supercomputer is superficially similar to a mainframe but is instead intended for extremely demanding computational tasks.

Software: Programs and instructions that tell the hardware what to do.
Includes operating systems like Windows and Linux, as well as applications.

Types: 
- Application software
- System software
    Operating systems
    Device drivers
    Utilities
-Malicious software

History:
An algorithm for what would have been the first piece of software
was written by Ada Lovelace in the 19th century, for the planned
Analytical Engine. She created proofs to show how the engine
would calculate Bernoulli numbers. Because of the proofs and the
algorithm, she is considered the first computer programmer.

File Management: Organizing, storing,
and accessing files on a computer system.

Usage:
File management involves organizing, storing, retrieving, and managing data files on a computer.
It helps users and software to efficiently locate and use files when needed.
Common tasks include creating, naming, moving, copying, and deleting files and folders.

Types:
Manual File Management: Users manually organize files into folders and subfolders.
Automated File Management: Software tools automatically organize and manage files based on predefined rules.

History:
File management has evolved from simple text-based systems in early computers to sophisticated graphical user interfaces (GUIs) today.
Early systems required users to type commands to manage files, but modern systems allow users to interact with files using icons and menus.
Notable developments include the introduction of the hierarchical file system in the 1960s
and the widespread adoption of GUIs in the 1980s with operating systems like Windows and macOS.

Browsers: Software applications for accessing and navigating the internet, 
like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

History: The first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming Languages: Tools for creating software and applications. 
Examples include Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, and many more.

Networking: The practice of connecting
computers and other devices to share resources and information. 
Includes concepts like TCP/IP, routers, switches, and protocols like HTTP and FTP.

Use:
Computer networks extend interpersonal communications by electronic means
with various technologies, such as email, instant messaging, online chat,
voice and video telephone calls, and video conferencing.

Network packet:
Most modern computer networks use protocols based on
packet-mode transmission. A network packet is a formatted unit
of data carried by a packet-switched network.

Network topology:
The physical or geographic locations of network nodes and links
generally have relatively little effect on a network,
but the topology of interconnections of a network can significantly
affect its throughput and reliability.
Common topologies are:
- Bus network
- Star network
- Ring network
- Mesh network
- Fully connected network
- Tree network

Cyber Security: Measures taken to protect computer systems and data from 
unauthorized access, attacks, and damage. Involves techniques like encryption, 
firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems.

Usage:
Cyber security involves protecting computers, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage.
It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
Common practices include using firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, and secure passwords.

Types:
Network Security: Protects network infrastructure from attacks and unauthorized access.
Information Security: Safeguards data from unauthorized access and alterations.
Application Security: Ensures software applications are secure from threats.
Operational Security: Protects the procedures and processes for handling and protecting data.

History:
Cyber security has its roots in the 1970s with the development of ARPANET, the precursor to the internet.
The first known computer virus, the Creeper virus, appeared in the early 1970s. As the internet grew,
so did the need for security measures. In the 1980s and 1990s, the rise of personal computers and the internet
led to the development of antivirus software and firewalls. Today, cyber security is a critical field,
constantly evolving to counter sophisticated threats like phishing, ransomware, and advanced persistent threats (APTs).

Office Programs: Software tools for office tasks, including spreadsheet editors 
(like Microsoft Excel), presentation programs (like Microsoft PowerPoint), 
database management systems (like Microsoft Access), 
audio managers, and photo editors (like Adobe Photoshop).

spreadsheet: The Spreadsheet Editor is an online
application that allows you to edit spreadsheets directly in your browser.

presentation: In computing, a presentation program
is a software package used to display
information in the form of a slide show.

database: Database Management Systems (DBMS)
are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data.
