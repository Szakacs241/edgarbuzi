            <p><strong>History:</strong></p>
            <p>Cyber security has its roots in the 1970s with the development of ARPANET, the precursor to the internet.</p>
            <p>The first known computer virus, the Creeper virus, appeared in the early 1970s. As the internet grew, so did the need for security measures.</p>
            <p>In the 1980s and 1990s, the rise of personal computers and the internet led to the development of antivirus software and firewalls.</p>
            <p>Today, cyber security is a critical field, constantly evolving to counter sophisticated threats like phishing, ransomware, and advanced persistent threats (APTs).</p>
